Once she asked for daddy, but went back to sleep when Carmen told her he was asleep;0
The medication they were giving her to clear up the congestion in her lungs was making her sleep a lot, but they thought that was better than having her upset all the time;0
You can sit up, but you have to stay in there;0
She met his gaze defiantly for a moment longer, but he made no attempt to argue;0
If it's something we simply can't afford, that's one thing, but we should be encouraging things like this, Alex;0
He said he would be gone for two days, but didn't say why he was going;0
He might not have heard what she said, but he must have heard her speak;0
He participated in conversation, but whenever it lagged, he watched her questioningly;0
Seducing him was something she thought would be difficult, but it was actually enjoyable;0
She had rehearsed her script earlier, but now the words evaded her;0
All that was true enough, but remaining bitter about it wasn't going to improve their relationship;0
It wasn't something she was looking forward to, but it might be helpful;0
Maybe she couldn't make the ugly beast go away completely, but she had learned to control it;0
She said he had kicked her out, but refused to say why;0
I would have thought a gender oriented decision would upset you, but you seem to be on his side;0
 It doesn't matter to me one way or another, but I wish you would at least make an effort at seeing his side of it;0
Alex pointed his fork at her and opened his mouth to speak, but Carmen cut him off;0
You know you love each other, but you aren't about to admit it;0
It couldn't have been more than a few seconds, but it seemed much longer;0
It may take a few minutes, but he'll catch on;0
Sure, they needed to clear the air about the inheritance issue, but that wasn't enough for Carmen;0
I have let her do this, but now I tell her she must be respectful;0
Carmen thought she wanted him to make the decisions, but she wanted to be involved with the process;0
Katie had been telling him that for years, but he hadn't seen it until now;0
You always liked living on the edge, but you've never been so impulsive;0
I'm sorry you're unhappy with my questions, but I need to know why you suddenly needed a girl after going five years without any;0
Sarah and Giddon both seemed content with the arrangement, but she felt guilty about the money she earned;0
Well, he has a home office and he goes there pretty often, but I can't figure out what he's doing;0
Sarah couldn't understand her desire to be alone, but she accepted it;0
He was willing to admit he was wrong, but he wasn't going to grovel;0
There might be a thousand explanations for what she had witnessed, but only one came to mind;0
She tried to push away from him but his embrace was too strong;0
She turned and started for the door, but his hand gripped her arm again;0
The logical thing to do was leave, but she had a good job and she wasn't sure there was anything untoward going on;0
He is handsome, but I've never met anyone with such mood;0
She replaced the checkbook and started to close the drawer, but a thick envelope caught her attention;0
I keep telling him that as long as he gives her money, she'll never get out of trouble, but he just says she's the only sister he has and he has the money;0
She searched around for a landmark that could be seen over the trees, but nothing was tall enough;0
She would have no fear of wandering around to find her way, but her injury prevented any exploration;0
His voice was rough, but the arm that encircled her waist held her gently;0
His hands might be soft, but he was capable of dealing with whatever came in his direction;0
She stepped away from him, but he grabbed one arm, turning her around to face him;0
He said nothing, but when they entered the kitchen to find Len sitting at the table, his expression was wary;0
She was facing Len, but kept Yancey in view;0
She stared at him, but he didn't look at her;0
She looked over the car and expressed her approval, but her mind was consumed with guilt;0
She hesitated a moment, wanting to tell him, but thinking she would be betraying Yancey if she did so;0
The restaurant was one that she had heard of, but couldn't afford to enjoy;0
It was too dark to see his expression, but it was obvious he was watching her;0
The porcelain clock on the wall proclaimed the time as ten minutes until twelve, but it didn't seem that late;0
It sounds good, but I'm supposed to meet Connie at noon;0
I don't know what he wanted, but he certainly put you in a reflective mood;0
She was tempted to try, but both he and Sarah would probably be watching;0
Maybe he didn't like to walk, but he was certainly good at it ;0
Suppressing the urge to laugh wasn't easy, but she managed it;0
Maybe there was nothing going on, but gut instinct said there was a story here ;0
She glanced up at Yancey, but he gave no indication he might give her any privacy;0
 I keep warning you about the wild life, but you have to learn for yourself;0
A soft breeze carried a faint familiar odor, but it was gone before she could identify it;0
Yancey wasn't back yet when she left, but she didn't need his approval;0
She darted around him and ran for the door, but he caught her half way;0
She turned the knob, but the door didn't open;0
She reached the door and looked back, expecting to find him right behind her, but he wasn't;0
I've kept my identity hidden for five years now, but I knew deep down inside that it couldn't last forever;0
When he opened the glove box, I was sure he'd come out with a gun, but he had a little tablet instead;0
I had already searched for the name Yancey Giddon, but found nothing;0
He did act hesitant about it, but his encouragement sounded sincere;0
I knew he and Lisa had dated for a long time, and I knew they had a falling out, but I never thought he'd try to hurt her physically;0
She started for the door again, but he caught her arm;0
She glanced at his face, but it betrayed no emotion;0
He did date occasionally, but he didn't appear to be serious about any of the girls;0
Their relationship was growing, but finding a place to cuddle was nearly impossible;0
It'll make things tough, but it's only a few months;0
I let our stupid house rules stand between us for a long time, but I was the one who finally broke them;0
I wanted to stay, but I thought you wanted to be alone with your mother;0
I'll try to send more as time passes, but you may need to remind me when your supply gets low;0
